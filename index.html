    <h1>Privacy Policy for PadelSesh</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 21, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how PadelSesh, operated by Singgih Tulus Makmud, an individual developer, ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the PadelSesh mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>PadelSesh is developed and operated by Singgih Tulus Makmud, an individual developer. As the sole owner and operator, references to "we," "us," and "our" throughout this policy refer to Singgih Tulus Makmud in relation to the PadelSesh App.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect different types of information based on how you use the App:</p>

    <h3>a) Information You Directly Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Player Names:</strong> The App allows you to input and store names for players participating in your padel matches. This information is entered directly by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Match History and Scores:</strong> The App stores the details of your padel matches, including scores and associated player names.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b) Information Collected Automatically (from your Device or via Third-Parties)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unique Device Identifiers:</strong> When you use the App, we may collect unique identifiers associated with your device (e.g., Identifier for Vendors - IDFV) to distinguish your App usage.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchase Information:</strong> Through our use of RevenueCat, a third-party service, we collect information related to your in-app purchases within the App. This includes details of the subscriptions or products you purchase, the purchase date, and subscription status. This data is linked to your unique device or app user identifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Usage Data:</strong> Through RevenueCat, we collect basic, anonymized usage data related to monetization features, such as when the App connects to RevenueCat's servers or when a purchase event occurs. This helps us understand the performance of the App's monetization features.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Access / Sensory Data (for OCR):</strong> The App uses your device's camera for the purpose of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This feature allows you to scan text (e.g., from a scoreboard) to input scores. <strong>Crucially, the image data captured by the camera for OCR is processed entirely on your device and is not stored by us or transmitted to our servers.</strong> The App only extracts the text from the image, and only that text (if you choose to use it) might be used for score input, which is then locally stored as part of match history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c) Inferences</h3>
    <p>We may draw conclusions or make inferences from the data collected, particularly from the purchase information and usage data provided by RevenueCat. These inferences help us understand user behavior patterns related to subscriptions (e.g., conversion rates, churn rates, popular subscription offerings). These inferences are used solely for internal business purposes to improve the App and its monetization strategy. They are <strong>not</strong> used to create detailed psychological profiles for advertising, nor are they disclosed to third parties for their independent use in creating such profiles.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide App Functionality:</strong> To enable you to save player names, record match scores, and track your padel game history.</li>
        <li><strong>To Facilitate In-App Purchases:</strong> To process and manage your subscriptions and other in-app purchases via RevenueCat.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve and Optimize the App:</strong> To understand user engagement with the App's features and monetization, identify areas for improvement, and optimize the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>To Analyze App Performance:</strong> To monitor the performance of the App and its monetization strategy, including tracking metrics like subscription retention and revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>For Customer Support:</strong> To respond to your inquiries, provide support, and troubleshoot issues.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.</li>
